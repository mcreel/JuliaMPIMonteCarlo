# JuliaMPIMonteCarlo
Illustrates using Julia and MPI to do Monte Carlo. Release v1.0 contains the versions used in the paper "A Note on Julia and MPI, with Code Examples" (see http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10614-015-9516-5), which used Julia v0.4. That code will no longer run, but it's left here in case someone wants to examine the code discussed in the paper.

# current info:
The code has been adapted to run on Julia 1.x. montecarlo.jl and the pi example are back in and running fine. The auction models may make a re-appearance at some point.
